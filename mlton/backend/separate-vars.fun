 * This pass copies some variables into new locations
 * so that the relatively naÃ¯ve AllocateVars can give one location
 * to each variable.
 *
 * Although this is pretty tightly coupled to the AllocateVars, it saves
 * us a lot of complexity in both, since the latter does not need to do any
 * contortions to try to return multiple variables
 *
 * Mechanically, what we do is find the loops in the program, and try our best
 * to split up variables so that no variable that would have to be on the
 * stack appears in any loop. So while we might end up with some extra copies,
 * by construction we don't really do so in any loop where we wouldn't have to
 * already do something similar in practice.
