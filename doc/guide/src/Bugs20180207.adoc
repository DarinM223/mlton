* <!Anchor(bug03)>
Bug in `CML.sync` with multiple enabled events.
+
Thanks to James Cooper for the bug report.
+
Fixed by commit <!ViewGitCommit(mlton,0de07d039)>.

* <!Anchor(bug03)>
Bug in <:SimplifyTypes:> <:SSA:> optimization pass.
+
Fixed by commit <!ViewGitCommit(mlton,ef0f05961)>.

* <!Anchor(bug02)>
Bugs in `MLton.size` and `MLton.share`; calling `MLton.size` or `MLton.share`
with a non-pointer variant of an object type that could be represented by either
a pointer or a non-pointer (e.g., the `NONE` variant of an `int list option`)
would segfault.
+
Fixed by commit <!ViewGitCommit(mlton,31689bc27)>.

* <!Anchor(bug01)>
Latent bug in `MLton.GC.collect`; an explicit `MLton.GC.collect` call was passed
`0` bytes requested rather than the bytes required by the return block(s).
+
Fixed by commit <!ViewGitCommit(mlton,1f4daa14d)>.
